    Hi, I'm Ethan Sze,<br>
    Data Science and Finance Sophomore at UMD
  </h2>
  <p class="text-3xl leading-relaxed">
    I am seeking to gain exposure in the field of quantitative finance. 
    I have already taken a few foundational courses in data analysis, statistics, 
    and data programming. These courses have given me a solid 
    foundation to build upon, and I look to continue developing my skills through 
    coursework, internships, and personal projects. After graduating, I aspire to 
    enter the workforce as an analyst and combine my love for finance and data 
    science to drive real world impact.

        <p>At Affinity Asset Advisors, 
          I have been working as an Analyst Intern since 2022, stationed in New York, NY. In this role, I have spearheaded efforts in biotech research, focusing on developing Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) models. This work has been instrumental in improving the accuracy of financial projections by 20% and boosting investor confidence by 15%. These enhancements have been critical for the firm's strategic decision-making and market positioning, highlighting my impact in areas crucial for business growth and investor relations. <br>
          In my capacity as an intern, I have also been heavily involved in utilizing R programming for conducting Monte Carlo simulations. This technical endeavor was aimed at evaluating the efficacy of one-arm and two-arm clinical trials. Through this sophisticated analysis, I significantly improved the accuracy of trial outcomes. The insights gained from this work have contributed to strategic planning and risk management, underlining my role in advancing the company's research capabilities and decision-making processes.
          Additionally, my tenure at Affinity Asset Advisors has allowed me to drive the exploration and development of paradigm-shifting opportunities within the realm of biotech research. My ability to effectively communicate research findings and modeling results to the company's executives has fostered an environment of forward-thinking and innovation. This role has not only enabled me to contribute to the company's strategic initiatives but also to develop a keen understanding of the biotech industry's research and development landscape.</p>
